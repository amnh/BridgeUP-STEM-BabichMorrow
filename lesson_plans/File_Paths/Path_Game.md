# The Path Game!

This game has been adapted from instructions written by Alexandra Walling (2017 Helen Fellow).

## Goals

1. Explain the difference between absolute and relative paths.
2. Use your knowledge of absolute and relative paths to navigate through a Linux-based file system game board.
3. Work in teams to write correct code for moving and copying files.

## Bash Commands to Know



## Rules

You're going to work in two teams of three where you rotate from being The File, The User, and The Navigator.

1. The Game Master (me!) will give the first team a prompt indicating where The File and The User should put their sloths on the game board.

2. The Navigator will write a command on the whiteboard, which will tell The User and The File where to move on the game board. If this command doesn't produce the desired result, The Game Master will declare an Error.

    a) If the command works, the team gets a point!
  
    b) If an Error is declared, the opposing team will have a chance to write a command to fulfill the prompt and earn a point.
    
3. The second team will now play a round of the game.

4. After both teams play a round, the team members originally playing The File will become The User, The User will become The Navigator, and The Navigator will become the file.

5. Whichever team ends up with the most points wins!
