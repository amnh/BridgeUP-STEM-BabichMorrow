# Machine Learning Review: Classification Activity

This activity was created with Camera Ford.

## Goals

The goal of this activity is to review two machine learning techniques that we have previously covered during internships: unsupervised classification (k-means clustering) and supervised classification. 

## Unsupervised Learning

Here you are playing the role of a computer performing k-means clustering. You will group your initial dataset into clusters, imitating the way that a computer would group the data when doing an unsupervised classification. First, group the data into 2 clusters. Then 3 clusters, and then 4 clusters. 

### Questions

1. For each cluster, how did you choose to group the data and why?

2. What classes/patterns did you notice in the different cluster groupings?

## Supervised Learning

### Initial Classification

In this step, you are playing the role of the scientist/programmer putting your initial data into classes (like the botanist identifying the flowers in the iris data, for example).

Look at the initial dataset. Choose 3 – 4 classes that can be made from it, and arrange the dataset into a “training dataset.” At least a few of the classes chosen for the training dataset should be different from the groupings chosen in Part 1.

#### Questions

1. What classes did you choose for your training dataset?

2. Write a description of the characteristic(s) that make up each class in the training set.

### Classifying New Data

Now that the computer has been "trained" with the training dataset, you can feed it new data from the additional dataset and place those data into the proper classes.

#### Questions

1. For each additional data point, how did you classify it and why?
