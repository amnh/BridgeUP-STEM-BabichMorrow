# Sloth Skull Machine Learning: Mini-presentation Guidelines

## Supervised learning

+ At least one feature plot (ellipse, boxplot, density)
  + Which traits are you showing?
+ What species/genuses are you analyzing?
+ Which supervised learning algorithm was best?
  + Show dotplot of accuracy values
+ Provide accuracy values both on the training and validation data
  + Which species were usually correctly classified?
  + Which species were often misclassified?
  
## Unsupervised learning

+ What species/genuses are you analyzing?
+ How did k-means clustering perform?
+ Compare the dendrograms from agglomerative and divisive clustering?
  + What species/genuses cluster together?
  + How do the dendrograms differ?
