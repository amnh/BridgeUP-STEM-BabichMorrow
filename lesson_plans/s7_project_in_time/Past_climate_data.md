# Past Climate Data

## WorldClim paleo climate

WorldClim offers past climate data from two different time periods: the Mid-Holocene (6000 years ago) and the Last Glacial Maximum (22,000 years ago). This data comes from GCMs (just like the future climate data!), but for this data, the GCMs have been projected back in time.

### Mid-Holocene

The Mid-Holocene Warm Period was a period of high global temperatures that occurred from about 7,000 years ago to 5,000 years ago.
