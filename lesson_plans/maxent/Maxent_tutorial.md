This tutorial has been adapted from [this Maxent tutorial](https://biodiversityinformatics.amnh.org/open_source/maxent/Maxent_tutorial2017.pdf) by Steven J. Phillips.

For this tutorial, you are going to perform Maxent on *Bradypus torquatus*. To perform a run, you need to supply a file containing presence localities, a directory containing environmental variables, and an output directory. Occurrence data has been provided in the `data\occurrence_data` folder (`torquatus.csv`) -- browse to that file location under the "Samples" heading.
