# GitHub Pull Requests :octocat:

Most of this diagram should look familiar (hint, it's right underneath our calendar). The only part of this workflow we haven't done yet is a pull request.

A pull request is a way for you to get the changes you've made to your code back into the original version of the repository. Let's say you've written some code to analyze our sloth data. Once you push it to your fork of the repository, it's available on GitHub for you, but the rest of the SlothSquad still can't see it. If you submit a pull request, however, your code can be pushed to the original repository. Then everyone else can get a copy of that code when they sync their fork.

Sound complicated? Let's give it a try.

Go to the online (remote) version of your forked sloth repository on GitHub. Select "New pull request" and click "compare across forks". The "base" fork should be "amnh/BridgeUP-STEM-BabichMorrow". Change the "head" fork to the name of your forked copy. Click "Create pull request" and type a title for your pull request.
