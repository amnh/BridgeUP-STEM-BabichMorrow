# GitHub Pull Requests :octocat:

Most of this diagram should look familiar (hint, it's right underneath our calendar). The only part of this workflow we haven't done yet is a pull request.

A pull request is a way for you to get the changes you've made to your code back into the original version of the repository. Let's say you've written some code to analyze our sloth data. Once you push it to your fork of the repository, it's available on GitHub for you, but the rest of the SlothSquad still can't see it. If you submit a pull request, however, your code can be pushed to the original repository. Then everyone else can get a copy of that code when they sync their fork.

Sound complicated? Let's give it a try.
