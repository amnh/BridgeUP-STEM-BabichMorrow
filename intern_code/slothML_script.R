#Script for machine learning with sloth skull data


# SUPERVISED LEARNING -----------------------------------------------------

# Load the caret package

# Import the dataset sloth_landmarks.csv (in the lesson_plans/machine_learning folder)
# Make sure to import "From Text (base)"


# View the data


# Exploratory data analysis -----------------------------------------------

# Refer to your code from intro_machinelearning_supervised.Rmd
# There are A LOT of variables in this dataset, so feel free to explore whatever you think looks most interesting
# Spend a little time on this looking at variables you think might be interesting later


# Use the featurePlot() function to look at the variables (you won't be able to see them all at once)
# You can color the plots based on species or genus to compare Choloepus to Bradypus


# Validation & training sets ----------------------------------------------

# Refer to your previous code to split your dataset into validation and training sets
