+ Click the checkbox next to the file, and click the "Commit" button.

+ Type a commit message in the "Commit message" box and then click the "Commit" button.
+ Click on the "Push" button with the green arrow: this will take that edit you just made and push it to the remote copy of the branch (the one you can see on the GitHub website).

## Directing --> Typing

+ Go to the Git window of RStudio and click on the blue arrow: this will pull the edits from the remote copy to your machine.
