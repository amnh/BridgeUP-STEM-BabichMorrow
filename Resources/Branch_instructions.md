# Working with Branches :tanabata_tree:

Branches allow us to work on different versions of the code in parallel, without affecting the "main" copy of our code on the master branch. In software development, branches are often used to work on new features. While the feature is in development, it doesn't affect the main code. Once the feature is completed, however, the branch can be merged into the master branch so that the main copy of the code now includes that new feature.

In our code, we can use one branch per sloth species, where you will work in pairs to write code for that species.

## Typing --> Directing

+ Save your changes to the script. The file will then show up in the Git tab of RStudio.
+ Click the checkbox next to the file, and click the "Commit" button.
+ A window will pop up where you will be able to see the difference between the original file and what you have added. Compare these versions: do you like the edits you made?
+ Type a commit message in the "Commit message" box and then click the "Commit" button.
+ Click on the "Push" button with the green arrow: this will take that edit you just made and push it to the remote copy of the branch (the one you can see on the GitHub website).

## Directing --> Typing

+ Go to the Git window of RStudio and click on the blue arrow: this will pull the edits from the remote copy to your machine.
+ Open the script file. Check to see that the edits your partner made are there.
